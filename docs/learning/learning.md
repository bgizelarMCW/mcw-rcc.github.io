# Learning Tutorials and Videos

In this section you will find a link to our YouTube channel, in which we will be adding videos about the usage of the cluster, how to write different types of scripts and general information that will guide you through the creation and execution of pipelines in the cluster.

This is a work in progress, please be patient while we create more videos. If you have any recommendations about any topic that you would like us to cover, please email us at [rcc_admin@mcw.edu](mailto:rcc_admin@mcw.edu).

You will also find here links to other videos or YouTube channels that we think are useful in learning about how to use a HPC cluster, and tutorials from other institutions that have a similar cluster to ours. If there is any additional content that you would like us to add, email us at [rcc_admin@mcw.edu](mailto:rcc_admin@mcw.edu) with any additional recommendations.

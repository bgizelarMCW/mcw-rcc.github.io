# HPC Clusters Tutorials

In this section, you'll find links to our comprehensive cluster guides, designed to help you get started with using the system effectively. Additionally, weâ€™ve included helpful resources from other institutions that operate similar clusters, offering supplementary information and best practices.

While we encourage you to explore these external guides, we recommend starting with our own documentation, as it is tailored specifically to our cluster. Please note that no two clusters are identical, so not all examples or instructions from other institutions may apply or function as expected in our environment.

[RCC Cluster Guide](../cluster/quickstart.md): This guide provides the essential steps to get started on the RCC, including instructions on how to write and submit a SLURM job. For more in-depth guidance and answers to advanced questions, you'll also find links to additional resources throughout the document.

[MCW RCC YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2FsgYZHYY9kUFuZ_9solEw){:target="_blank"}: This channel features videos on creating scripts that are optimized for our cluster. We will continue to add content on a variety of topics, including containers, Python for data science, job submission and monitoring, and much more.

[Princeton  Research Computing](https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/get-started/guide-princeton-clusters){:target="_blank"}: Princeton University operates a cluster that functions similarly to ours, including the use of the SLURM scheduler. Their guide provides a clear and detailed explanation of cluster fundamentals, including how clusters work and other key concepts.

[Department Of Defense](https://centers.hpc.mil/users/docs/navy/nautilusSlurmGuide.html){:target="_blank"}: The Department of Defense operates a cluster that also uses SLURM, and their documentation covers how to create, submit, and monitor jobs. While much of this information is included in our own documentation, you may find additional examples, use cases, and topics in their guide. They also provide valuable insights on managing resources to optimize performance and maximize overall throughput.
